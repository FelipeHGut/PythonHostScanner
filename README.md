# PythonHostScanner

This is a personal learning project to learn more about networking, python scripting and API calls used by Python modules. 

Description:
A script to find connected hosts in the same network as the host where the script is run.
The script takes no arguments. The script allows you to save the results of any found hosts. 
It also allows you to run a port scan on those host founds. The script can be run on a Windows machine or Linux machine.

Notes:
The script requires administrative privileges to run. 

Know issues:
- Running in Windows use still requires further testing. 
- Manual interrupts still require to stop scanning a subnet.
